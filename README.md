# How Chronic diseases Affects People's lives in the USA

## Introduction

I have choosen Chronic Disease indicator data set for my project.This project is used to identify the most valued Data Analytics skills. Based on the studies I have categorized Data Analytics into two broad skills.

#### Soft Skills
1. Communication
2. Critical thinking
3. Problem Solving
4. Learning
5. Data Intiuition

#### Hard Skills
1. Data Analysis
2. Data Visualizatiion

#### Tools used for Data Analysis
1. Python (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy) 
2. Power Bi

### Background

Center of disease controly  and prevention provides cross-cutting set of 203 indicators that allows state and territories to uniformly define, collect and report chronic disease data that are important to public health problem which can result in morbidity, mortility, disability and decreased quality of life. Chronic disease dataset represents 7 of the top 10 causes of death in United States. Chronic disease vary by geographic area like country and states where essential public health intervention are needed.

### Objective

1. Correlation between premature mortalities among adults and chronic condition.
2. Does poverty and lack of insurance cause premature mortalities in states ?
3. Mortalities trend by year, gender and race.



### Datasource

Here is the link of dataset

[Chronic Diseases](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-/g4ie-h725)


### Aproach

Inspecting 15 years data from 2001 to 2016 which has 519718 rows and 34 columns.Also we have lot of missing data.
Clean and remove all the missing data. Drop and rename columns according to the requirement and change data types accordingly.
In this chart you can see the distribution of different chronic disease in this dataset.

### Conclusion 

Today only a small fraction of the United States governmental healthcare investment supports prevention and health promotion. A substantial investment in the State health departments and other health agencies must be made for a real impact. The investment needs to be such that every state in America has full complement of evidence-based programs to health and fight chronic disease especially in states like Oklahoma, West Virginia, Mississippi, Montana, Louisiana and Arkansas where premature mortalities among adults are higher, as well as the necessary resources to coordinate these programs with related activities(medicaid, CHIP). These programs must include resources for every state to address
1. Early detection of Cancer
2. Diabetes Prevention and Control (including prevention of kidney disease)
3. Health Community Programs
4. Improving physical Activity and Nutrition
5. Tobacco prevention and Control
6. School health and Oral Health Programs
