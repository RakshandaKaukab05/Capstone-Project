# How Chronic diseases Affects People's lives in the USA

## Introduction

I have choosen Chronic Disease indicator data set for my project.This project is used to identify the most valued Data Analytics skills. Based on the studies I have categorized Data Analytics into two broad skills.

#### Soft Skills
1. Communication
2. Critical thinking
3. Problem Solving
4. Learning
5. Data Intiuition

#### Hard Skills
1. Data Analysis
2. Data Visualizatiion

#### Tools used for Data Analysis
1. Python (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy) 
2. Power Bi

### Background

Center of disease controly  and prevention provides cross-cutting set of 203 indicators that allows state and territories to uniformly define, collect and report chronic disease data that are important to public health problem which can result in morbidity, mortility, disability and decreased quality of life. Chronic disease dataset represents 7 of the top 10 causes of death in United States. Chronic disease vary by geographic area like country and states where essential public health intervention are needed.

### Objective

1. Correlation between premature mortalities among adults and chronic condition.
2. Does poverty and lack of insurance cause premature mortalities in states ?
3. Mortalities trend by year, gender and race.



### Datasource

Here is the link of dataset

### Aproach

Inspecting 15 years data from 2001 to 2016 which has 519718 rows and 34 columns.Also we have lot of missing data.
Clean and remove all the missing data. Drop and rename columns according to the requirement and change data types accordingly.
In this chart you can see the distribution of different chronic disease in this dataset.

## Conclusion

As this data analysis shows states have higher poverty rate and lack of insurance have also  higher premature mortalities. This analysis  supports the studies from Harvard medical school shows that 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage. Studies found 40 percent increase risk of death among the uninsured. Every other developed nation has achieved through some form of non-profit national health insurance. Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care cost.
